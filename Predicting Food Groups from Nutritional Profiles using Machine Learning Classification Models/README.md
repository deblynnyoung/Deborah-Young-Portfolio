# Predicting Food Groups from Nutritional Profiles using Machine Learning Classification Models

## Description
This project aims to automate the categorization of foods into their respective food groups based on nutritional content. Utilizing the MyFoodData database informed by the USDA's FoodData Central, the project employs machine learning models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of food classification, which has traditionally been a manual and error-prone process.

## Key Features
- Utilizes a comprehensive dataset covering a wide range of nutritional information.
- Implements advanced machine learning models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- Employs techniques like SMOTE and RandomUnderSampler to address class imbalance.
- Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
Detailed requirements will be specific to the machine learning environment and the programming language used (e.g., Python, R). Libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy are typically required.

## Setup and Installation
Instructions will vary depending on the machine learning framework and language used. Generally, involves setting up a machine learning environment, installing necessary libraries, and cloning the repository for local development.

## Usage
The models can be used to predict food group classifications from nutritional data inputs. The usage instructions will provide a guide on how to input data into the model and interpret the output classifications.

## Data Analysis Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for assessing data quality and distribution.
- Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction to identify relevant features.
- Modeling with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
- Resampling techniques to balance the dataset.

## Conclusion
Machine learning models have demonstrated high effectiveness in categorizing foods, with Random Forest providing promising results for real-world application when combined with appropriate resampling techniques.
