# Preparation, Transformation, and Visualization of Opioid Overdose Data

## Description
This project encompasses the preparation, transformation, and visualization of opioid overdose data, aimed at understanding the overdose trends and their implications across different regions. By employing SQL for data management and Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for analysis and visualization, the project provides insightful analyses on overdose deaths, prescription rates, and their correlation with factors like housing availability.

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation and Transformation**: Utilization of SQL to efficiently manage and transform complex datasets for analysis.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: In-depth analysis of opioid overdose trends, including demographic and regional impacts.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Creation of line plots, bar plots, and histograms to visualize trends and patterns in the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Examination of correlations between opioid overdoses and socio-economic indicators such as housing availability.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLite
- SQL knowledge for database management and queries

## Setup and Installation
1. Ensure Python and SQLite are installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
3. Copy code
4. import pandas matplotlib seaborn
5. Prepare the database and tables using SQLite based on the provided scripts.

## Usage
- Execute the Python scripts for data preparation, transformation, and visualization.
- Use SQL queries within SQLite for data manipulation and to facilitate analysis.

## Error Handling
- Includes data cleaning steps to handle missing or inconsistent data entries.
- Utilizes try-except blocks in Python for robust error management.

## Project Summary
The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to handling, analyzing, and visualizing opioid overdose data, highlighting the potential of data science in public health research. It underscores the importance of clean, well-organized data for generating meaningful insights and the power of visualizations in communicating these findings.
