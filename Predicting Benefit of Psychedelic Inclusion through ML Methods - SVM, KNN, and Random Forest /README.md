# Predicting Benefit of Psychedelic Inclusion through ML Methods - SVM, KNN, and Random Forest

## Description
This project investigates the potential benefits of integrating psychedelics into medical practice for improving mental health and personal growth. Utilizing machine learning techniques—Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest—this study analyzes data from naturalistic psychedelic use to predict positive outcomes of such integration. The analysis aims to support future personalized medicine by identifying individuals who may benefit from psychedelic therapy.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Explores an extensive dataset on naturalistic psychedelic use, including demographic information, drug use history, and the long-term effects of use.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Models**: Employs SVM, KNN, and Random Forest algorithms to predict the likelihood of beneficial outcomes from psychedelic use.
- **Insightful Visualizations**: Generates visual representations of model performance and the relationships between various factors related to psychedelic use.
- **High Prediction Accuracy**: Achieves a notable prediction accuracy, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in assessing the suitability of psychedelic therapy for individuals.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.x or R programming language
2. Libraries: Scikit-learn (for Python) or relevant R packages for the chosen models
3. Dataset: An Exploration of Naturalistic Psychedelic Use

## Setup and Installation
1. Install Python 3.x or R and ensure the correct environment is set up.
2. Install necessary libraries or packages using pip (for Python) or install.packages() (for R).
3. Obtain the dataset and prepare it according to the preprocessing steps outlined in the project.

## Usage
- Execute the analysis script to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
- Review the generated plots and metrics to understand the predictive capabilities of each model.

## Error Handling
- Implements robust data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers.
- Uses cross-validation techniques to ensure model reliability and generalizability.
