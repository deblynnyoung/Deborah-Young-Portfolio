Description\
The project, conducted by Deborah Young, focuses on the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) analysis, exploring the diversity and presence of microbial communities in the human body. The research aims to understand the distribution and characteristics of these microorganisms, particularly in relation to various body sites, using data mining and machine learning techniques.\
