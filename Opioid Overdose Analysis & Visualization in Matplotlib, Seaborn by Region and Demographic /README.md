# Opioid Overdose Analysis & Visualization

## Description
This project explores opioid overdose deaths across the United States from 2013 to 2019, utilizing datasets that include overdose deaths, death rates, population, and income data for each state. The goal is to identify trends over time and understand the impact of various state characteristics on overdose death rates. The analysis is conducted using Python with Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

## Key Features
- **Regional Overdose Analysis**: Insights into how different regions are affected.
- **Demographic Impact Study**: Examination of the crisis's effects on various demographic groups.
- **Trend Visualization**: Analysis of opioid overdose trends over time.
- **Comparative Regional Analysis**: Comparison of overdose impacts across different areas.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy libraries

## Setup and Installation
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Execute pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy to install required libraries.

## Usage
The project involves running a Python notebook that processes and visualizes the opioid overdose data. Users can explore different visualizations to understand trends and demographic impacts on overdose rates.

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling for data input and analysis processes, ensuring robust analysis workflow.
