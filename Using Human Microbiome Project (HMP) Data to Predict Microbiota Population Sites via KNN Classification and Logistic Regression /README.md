# Human Microbiome Project (HMP) Analysis

## Description
This project, led by Deborah Young, delves into the Human Microbiome Project to explore the diversity and presence of microbial communities in the human body. Utilizing data mining and machine learning techniques, it aims to understand the distribution and characteristics of these microorganisms across various body sites.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A thorough analysis of microbial data including genus, gene count, and distribution across body sites.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Rigorous preprocessing to ensure data quality.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applying K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression to predict microbial presence at different body sites.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation and scaling of features to enhance model performance.

## Requirements
- Python with Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
- Understanding of data preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning.

## Setup and Installation
1. Install Python and the required libraries.
2. Download the HMP dataset from the NIH Human Microbiome Project website.
3. Load the dataset into a Python environment for analysis.

## Usage
- Clean and transform the data.
- Conduct EDA to understand microbial community characteristics.
- Train and evaluate KNN and Logistic Regression models.
- Derive insights about the human microbiome from the analysis.

## Data Analysis Techniques
- EDA for microbial diversity.
- Predictive modeling for microbial location forecasting.
- Model evaluation based on accuracy and other metrics.

## Conclusion
This research underscores the human microbiome's importance in health and disease, providing valuable insights into the microorganisms' distribution and characteristics within the human body.
