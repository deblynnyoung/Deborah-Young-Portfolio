# Generalized Linear Modeling for Predicting Opioid Prescription Across Specialties

## Description
This project applies Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM) to predict opioid prescription trends across medical specialties. Utilizing a dataset from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service, the analysis focuses on identifying patterns that could suggest the need for enhanced opioid care facilities or educational programs, aiming to mitigate the opioid crisis through data-driven insights.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses GLM to forecast opioid prescribing behaviors.
- **Specialty-Based Insights**: Examines how different medical specialties contribute to prescription patterns.
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Proposes targeted interventions for opioid care based on analysis.

## Requirements
- R programming language
- Relevant R packages: ggplot2, dplyr, caTools, hmisc, ggm, tidyverse, QuantPsyc, car

## Setup and Installation
1. Ensure R and RStudio are installed.
2. nstall required R packages using install.packages("package_name").

## Usage
1. Run the R scripts provided to perform the analysis.
2. The main analysis script utilizes GLM to model and predict opioid prescriptions.


## Error Handling
Includes error handling for missing data and ensures robust model performance.
