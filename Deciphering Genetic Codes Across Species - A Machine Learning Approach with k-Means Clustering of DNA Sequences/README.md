# Deciphering Genetic Codes Across Species - A Machine Learning Approach with k-Means Clustering of DNA Sequences

## Description
This project explores the use of machine learning, particularly k-means clustering, to uncover patterns within nucleotide sequences from the DNA of humans, chimpanzees, and dogs. It seeks to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze genetic information, thereby aiding genomics and bioinformatics research.

## Key Features
- K-means clustering of genomic data across species.
- NLP-based approach for sequence processing.
- Analysis of sample sequences due to computational constraints.
- Utilization of public datasets for model training and testing.

## Requirements
- Python for programming.
- Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for clustering.
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development.

## Usage
The implemented models and analyses can be executed within Jupyter Notebooks, with step-by-step instructions provided in the notebooks themselves.

## Data Analysis Techniques
- Data preprocessing with Pandas.
- K-mer frequency analysis for sequence representation.
- Clustering using k-means and MiniBatchKMeans.
- Elbow method for optimal cluster count determination.
- Dimensionality reduction for data visualization.

## Conclusion
The project serves as a preliminary investigation into the use of machine learning for genomic sequence analysis. It highlights the potential of NLP techniques in uncovering genetic patterns and sets the stage for further research with more comprehensive datasets.
